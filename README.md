## Blackjack-Game

In Blackjack, the objective is to have a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it. Number cards retain their face value, face cards are worth 10, and Aces can be 1 or 11. Players and the dealer are dealt two cards each, with players aiming for a total of 21 (Blackjack) or a higher value than the dealer. Players can "hit" for more cards or "stand" to keep their current total. The dealer must hit until reaching at least 17. Doubling down allows players to double their bet and receive one more card. Splitting is an option if the initial two cards are of the same value. Insurance is available if the dealer's upcard is an Ace. The game's simplicity and strategic choices make it a popular casino card game.
